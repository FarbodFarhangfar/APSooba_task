also there is comment and note all over the code 

...............

after exploration , data cleaning and correlation 

we need to standrize price , because it does not follow normal ditubation and that will be a problem for probility forcast

there are strong correlation between price and features selected , 
but also some features added or deleted based on training and result that I got for each model

some insight may be :

there is a strong connection between DomTotalOutage , DomPlannedOutage , that means most of outage are planned,
so most likly there is no problem 

there is no timeseries trend overall

there is a strong correlation between feelslike and demand : so we do not need feelslike but it is good to know

the day of the month and the hour of the day have correlation with price , so we create these

I also add historical price data , beacuse most likly price can effect itself


...............

there is a fastapi app that runs on micro service architecture on docker 

...............

there is interactice dashboard with streamlit run .\dashboard.py

...............

also I have a mlflow sample code but since I used google colab for this , that did not come in handy
but I know how to use it
